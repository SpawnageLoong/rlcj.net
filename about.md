## "Nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution."

<br>
I am a pretty lazy person. I believe that the best things in life, are those that require the least effort to use. That, and really cool stuff that make my monkey brain go "Oooh, shiny!". These two things can basically sum up my entire project portfolio.

This blog is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other random stuff that comes to mind.

And if you're worndering what's with the quote, it was a placeholder that describes itself so well that I'm not going to change it.
